\section{Disclaimer}

While the accuracy of neurotransmitter prediction is high on our test sets, not
all predictions are guaranteed to be correct. In particular, we do not know how
the network behaves for all neurons in the brain. While we have not observed
this so far, it is possible that some neurons in the brain are ``out of
distribution'', i.e. so different to anything the network has seen during
training that it results in misprediction.

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
Under normal circumstances the likelihood for a wrong prediction goes down with
the number of annotated, and predicted synapses in a neuron. Any prediction
based on less than 100 synapses should be viewed as uncertain. In such a case
we recommend to annotate more synapses, in the ideal case picking sites to
annotate at random from the entirety of the neuron, and request another round
of predictions. Any prediction that does not have a clear majority
neurotransmitter should be considered uncertain. For further details see our
preprint\footnote{\url{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148775v1}}.

If this data is useful to you and you happen to experimentally determine the
neurotransmitter of some of the neurons in this dataset, please get in touch so
we can incorporate the data in our evaluation and training, and make the method
more accurate for everyone.
